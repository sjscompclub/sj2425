Downloading the website source codes
====================================

We have hosted all our work---including the source code for our public
website---on the GitHub repository. To download the entire source folder onto
your laptop, please run the following statements: 


.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    :~$ cd 
    :~$ cd Documents
    :~$ git clone git@github.com:sjscompclub/sj2425.git sj2425.git

.. Attention::

    In the above, please note that:

    * the special characters---*colon, tilde and dollar sign, ':~$'*---are NOT
      part of the statements, so please do not type or copy them when you run
      these statements; 
    * these statements have to be executed in the terminal;and
    * each statement ends with pressing the <ENTER> key on your keyboard.



    
The statements perform the following:

* Line 1 (*cd*) takes you to your home directory.
* Line 2 (*cd Documents*) takes you to your **Documents** folder.
* Line 3 (*the last statement*) downloads your source codes from the internet on your **Documents** folder.

On download completion, you should have a new folder, **sj2425.git**, in your 
**Documents** folder, with all website source files and folders.
