====================
Website Source Codes
====================

All our works---including our public website source codes---are hosted in the Github repository. 

Downloading the website source codes
------------------------------------

To download the website source codes on your laptop, please run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    :~$ cd 
    :~$ cd Documents
    :~$ git clone git@github.com:sjscompclub/sj2425.git sj2425.git
  
.. note:: 

    The above commands download the website codes from the **GitHub** repository in
    your **Documents** folder.  On completion,  you should have a new
    folder---named **www.git**, inside your **Documents** folder---with all the files. 
    
Opening the Source Code folder on VS Code
-----------------------------------------

Run the following commands to open the website source code folder on Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

.. code-block:: console

    :~$ cd 
    :~$ cd Documents/sj2425.git
    :~$ code .

.. Attention::

    By the way, I hope you haven’t forgotten that:

    * all above statements (commands) have to be executed in the terminal; and 
    * each statement ends with pressing the <ENTER> key on your keyboard.


Project Repository Structure
----------------------------

Once downloaded on your laptop, your source code folder structure should be similar to the following diagram:

The *index.html* file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Index.html is the most common file name that most websites serve if a requesting user has not specified the file name. 

The *assets* folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will store the website's styling (CSS) files, animation (JavaScript) files, and images in this folder.

Each student will have their own  CSS and JavaScript files that they may store in the subfolders of this folder.

The *conor* folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conor will store his HTML and other files and folders in this folder.

The *emmet* folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Emmet will store his HTML and other files and folders in this folder.

The *harry* folder

The *support* folder

This folder holds all supporting documents, including this page file, to help students for the project.

The *test1* and *test2* folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will test our work in one of these folders.


    
Summary
-------

With the website source codes fully downloaded on your laptop and your
understanding of the structure, you are now ready to start coding.

.. warning::

    By now, you should have realised that each of you has an assigned directory
    where you save your files and folders. 

    Please ensure that you save your work only in your assigned directory.

Happy coding!
