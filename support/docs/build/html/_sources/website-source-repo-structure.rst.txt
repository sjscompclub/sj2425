The *index.html* file
---------------------

Index.html is the most common file name that most websites serve if a requesting user has not specified the file name. 

The *assets* folder
-------------------

We will store the website's styling (CSS) files, animation (JavaScript) files, and images in this folder.

Each student will have their own  CSS and JavaScript files that they may store in the subfolders of this folder.

The *conor* folder

Conor will store his HTML and other files and folders in this folder.
